                  A Terms and Conditions agreement (T&Cs) is the agreement that
                  includes the terms, the rules and the guidelines of acceptable
                  behavior and other useful sections to which users must agree
                  in order to use or access your website and mobile app.

                  <br /> In the case of a business, it is often a statement that
                  declares a party's policy on how it collects, stores, and
                  releases personal information it collects. It informs the
                  client what specific information is collected, and whether it
                  is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other
                  firms or enterprises[3].[4] Privacy policies typically
                  represent a broader, more generalized treatment, as opposed to
                  data use statements, which tend to be more detailed and
                  specific.
