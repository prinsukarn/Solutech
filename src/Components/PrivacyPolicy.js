                  A <b>privacy policy</b> is a statement or legal document (in
                  privacy law) that discloses some or all of the ways a party
                  gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a customer or client's
                  data.[1] Personal information can be anything that can be used
                  to identify an individual, not limited to the person's name,
                  address, date of birth, marital status, contact information,
                  ID issue, and expiry date, financial records, credit
                  information, medical history, where one travels, and
                  intentions to acquire goods and services.[2]
                  <br />
                  <br /> In the case of a business, it is often a statement that
                  declares a party's policy on how it collects, stores, and
                  releases personal information it collects. It informs the
                  client what specific information is collected, and whether it
                  is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other
                  firms or enterprises[3].[4] Privacy policies typically
                  represent a broader, more generalized treatment, as opposed to
                  data use statements, which tend to be more detailed and
                  specific.
